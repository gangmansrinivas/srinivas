# LogisticRegrastion

# **Project** **Title** **:** To predict the heart attact diseas for organisation WHO(world health orginisation),using machine learninig algarithem rate of heart attack diseas will increasing manner or decreasing manner


# **problem** **statement** **:** A world helth orgaination estimated 12million death records.One of them half of the death result is found in us.The reasearch scallors point out  the most relavent risk factor of heart attack as a data science engineer predict the ovaral risk using machine learning algorithem called as logistic regresstion

# Task1:
Import the libraries which is requeriad for prediction

# Task2:
Import the dataset you using work space.

# Task3:
Use the apropriate argument of sklearn library to train,test and split the datasets

# Task4:
Fit your values with arange function using future scaling

# Task5:
Check your model accuracy and presition using confusion matrix

### CONCLUSION: According to the model analysis LogisticRehrastion algorithem work sussesfully with 0.6 accuracy.
# The accuracy shows that building the midel is sussesfull.
